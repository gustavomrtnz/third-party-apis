# Task Board

## Description
As a user i want to be able to set up a task with the title, description and due date of the task. As a user I aslo want to be able to drag the rendered task between one of three categories (TO DO, IN PROGRESS, DONE). I also want to be able to delte tasks that have been fufilled. This task board allows for an easy way to manage Tasks and easily drag them between the different categories which as the User Story states, could be very helpful for a PROJECT MANAGE.

## User Story
